As the scale and scope of data collection continue to increase across virtually all fields, statistical learning has become a critical toolkit for anyone who wishes to understand data. An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides a broad and less technical treatment of key topics in statistical learning. This book is appropriate for anyone who wishes to use contemporary tools for data analysis. 

The first edition of this book, with applications in R (ISLR), was released in 2013. A 2nd Edition of ISLR was published in 2021. It has been translated into Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Russian, and Vietnamese. The Python edition (ISLP) was published in 2023.

Each edition contains a lab at the end of each chapter, which demonstrates the chapterâ€™s concepts in either R or Python. 

The chapters cover the following topics:

- What is statistical learning?
- Regression
- Classification
- Resampling methods
- Linear model selection and regularization
- Moving beyond linearity
- Tree-based methods
- Support vector machines
- Deep learning
- Survival analysis
- Unsupervised learning
- Multiple testing
