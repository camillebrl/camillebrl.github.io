      abstract={The field of visually-rich document understanding, which involves interacting with visuallyrich documents (whether scanned or borndigital), is rapidly evolving and still lacks consensus on several key aspects of the processing pipeline. In this work, we provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art approaches, emphasizing their strengths and limitations, pointing out the main challenges in the field, and proposing promising research directions.},

      abstract={Despite outstanding processes in many tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) still lack accuracy when dealing with highly technical domains. Especially, telecommunications (telco) is a particularly challenging domain due the large amount of lexical, semantic and conceptual peculiarities. Yet, this domain holds many valuable use cases, directly linked to industrial needs. Hence, this paper studies how LLMs can be adapted to the telco domain. It reports our effort to (i) collect a massive corpus of domain-specific data (800M tokens, 80K instructions), (ii) perform adaptation using various methodologies, and (iii) benchmark them against larger generalist models in downstream tasks that require extensive knowledge of telecommunications. Our experiments on Llama-2-7b show that domain-adapted models can challenge the large generalist models. They also suggest that adaptation can be restricted to a unique instruction-tuning step, dicarding the need for any fine-tuning on raw texts beforehand.},
